However, we had a strong enough frontend to give us more time till finals, to add the last backend feature. At the time of writing, we we're able to get the backend ready (since we had an extra day), a working frontend, and need to merge the two. \n",

We had everything on our original plan done by qualifications, but still had to work on the final project. The main thing we couldve worked on would be to make cooler css. We had the same css on every game page, but it couldve looked better\n",

    "#### Individual CPT Project Plans:\n",
    "We didnt get any direct feedback, but I plan to add a few more things to make our wesbite cooler. I'll be working consistently over the break in order to make sure the project looks great, especially since we needed more time. \n",
