# Week 2
During week 2, I want to finish setting my blog page in the CSP folder of my site so I can make blogs for my plans, hacks, and games. 
- I want to be able to make a tic tac toe game using the skills we learned on Monday. 
- I want to finish configuring my CSP blog page so i can start to create posts about my plans, ahcks, and games.

Here's my "Tic Tac Toe" game I amde in python. 

## Code
def print_board(board):
  print("TICTACTOE")
  for row in board:
    print(" | ".join(row))
    print("---------")


def check_winner(board, player):
  for row in board:
    if all(cell == player for cell in row):
      return True
  for col in range(3):
    if all(board[row][col] == player for row in range(3)):
      return True
  if all(board[i][i] == player
         for i in range(3)) or all(board[i][2 - i] == player
                                   for i in range(3)):
    return True
  return False


def is_board_full(board):
  return all(cell != " " for row in board for cell in row)


def play_game():
  board = [[" " for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]
  current_player = "X"

  while True:
    print_board(board)
    print(f"Player {current_player}'s turn")
    
    col = int(input("Enter column (0, 1, 2): "))
    while True:  
      if col in (0, 1, 2):
        break
      else: 
        col = int(input("Enter column PROPERLY (0, 1, 2): "))
        
    
    row = int(input("Enter row (0, 1, 2): "))
    while True:  
      if row in (0, 1, 2):
        break
      else: 
        row = int(input("Enter row PROPERLY (0, 1, 2): "))
        
    if board[row][col] == " ":
      board[row][col] = current_player
      if check_winner(board, current_player):
        print_board(board)
        print(f"Player {current_player} wins!")
        break
      elif is_board_full(board):
        print_board(board)
        print("It's a draw!")
        break
      else:
        current_player = "O" if current_player == "X" else "X"
    else:
      print("That cell is already occupied. Try again.")


play_game()




# Issues

One of the biggest issues with this game was that you could select a number that was not 0,1, or 2, and it would crash. So to avoid this, I created an loop using true/false to stop a user from putting in numbers that are not 0,1, and 2, as well as keep the game from crashing.
