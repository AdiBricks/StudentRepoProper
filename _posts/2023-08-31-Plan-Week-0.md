# Week 0
By the end of this first week, I plan to have finished a complete tool setup, have a running blog page, in order to start customization by next week. 
Since I was working on a chromebook, the set up proccess was a little different that for windows/mac.
1. Make a vscode directory, and start using it as your main directory for you files.
2. Clone the teacher repository from github using HTTPS protocol. After that, you have succesfully create the repository for the teacher.
3. After that, you need to create your Github repository by forking over the content from the teacher repository. 
4. Sometimes, errors occur. Its always best to go over everything you have already done, to make sure you did not leave anything out. 
5. A good thing to do, get familiar with some of the basic folder/files. 
    - index.md is used as your main home page, the landing page viewers land on when the come to your site.
    - comfig.yml allows you to change the theme (using already existing, preset options) of your website.
    - using the _posts folder, you can edit and create posts of your choice to add to your blog page for your viewers to look at.
