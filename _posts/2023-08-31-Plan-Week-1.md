# Week 1
During week 1, I want to be able to create a working homepage with some features that show and describe a little about myself. Here's the list of things I plan to do. 
- Embed my 360 youtube video using iframe
- Embed and create a number generator game
- Customize my home page (background theme)
- Draw and embed my freeform picture.

Issues
- Embedding a 360 degree video using iframe does not work with a general embed. By edititng the site link to add the proper embed. To do this, I removed "watch" for the share link of my youtube video, and added embed instead. 
- One big problem with my number generator game was embedding it properly with html. I did this by adding a "<html>" and "<head>" at the start of the code, and the ending the code with "<body>" and "<html>".
