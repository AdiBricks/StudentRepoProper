# Week 8 Plan
- Finish HW for Iteration and Boolean If
- Split roles for the Project
- Finish work on 360 Viewer. In order to create uniqueness to our website, we added a 360 viewing garage for viewers to look at, so they can feel the experience of renting one of our cars.

Creating the image: In order to create a 360 image, we reached out to other art/elective classes. Through past learning experiences, we retrieved models of cars from websites and incorporated them into a car garage using Blender from Mr.Askegreenâ€™s 3D animation class. Then, we rendered in an equirectangular format.
Applying it: We tried multiple ways to incorporate a 3D viewer into our website, but it seems unrealistic, as it used too much of our time. Since we had big goals and ambitions, we used another 360 viewer website, and linked it to that, to focus on the more important parts of our website.
