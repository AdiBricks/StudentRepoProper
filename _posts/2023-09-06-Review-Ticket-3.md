# Review Ticket:
This week, I planned my activities, including creating a Connect 4 game, working on Python Tricks, and adding a YouTube search bar using JavaScript for our website. I talked with my partner about our project and prepared for feedback. I also uploaded changes to my GitHub.io server and focused on gathering and using feedback from teachers and peers. We planned our live review presentation and aimed to finish it within 3 minutes. In programming, I improved the Connect 4 game by adding a computer player and updating the console display. For the web, we worked on a YouTube search feature using an API. Lastly, I created a review ticket for week 3 and practiced our pair showcase, explaining different types of hacks and what they mean.
