# Review Ticket
For Week 0, I set up my working environment and started creating a functional blog page, laying the foundation for future additions. I created a dedicated directory for my files, cloning the teacher repository from GitHub, and forking content to establish my GitHub repository. Additionally, I familiarized myself with essential files and folders, such as "index.md" for the homepage and "config.yml" for theme customization, while also exploring the "_posts" folder for creating and editing blog posts.
