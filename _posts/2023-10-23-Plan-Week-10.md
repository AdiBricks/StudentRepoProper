# Week 10 Plan
- Finish work on renting feature on vehicles page:
    - Idea: In order to rent our vehicles, we worked on a process to create a working script! The first function, "displayRentalInfo," retrieves URL parameters using URLSearchParams from the current page's URL and shows the car's name, prices per hour and day, and an image based on the extracted parameters from the OG page, advertised on the vehicles main page.
- Start work on about page with a PARALLEX affect over the weekend! 
- Get ready to qualify for N@TM
- Work on issues and requalify to get into the N@TM!
